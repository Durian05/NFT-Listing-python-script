# NFT-REListing-python-script
for all questions, write, I will help
the script that cleans is not on the opensea website
to use it, you need to have python installed, download the selenium library and download drivers for selenium,
you can read how to do it here https://habr.com/ru/post/248559/
the script itself works very simply
you need to specify a password, a mnemonic phrase and prices
This script will only work if you downloaded the nft through a smart contract
